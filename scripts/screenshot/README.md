# Screenshot harness

Renders the real plugin app (app.tsx + components/) against a mocked
`@get-bb/plugin-sdk/app` with simulated threads, then captures the README
screenshots in `docs/screenshots/` with headless Chrome. No bb server or
host app involved.

- `data.ts` — simulated projects, providers, and threads (shapes mirror the
  SDK's `PluginSidebarThread`).
- `mock-sdk.tsx` — SDK stand-in: hooks return the simulated state, and
  `ThreadChat` renders a canned conversation. Vite aliases the SDK specifier
  here, so the app code runs unmodified.
- `main.tsx` — seeds localStorage from the query string (`?groupBy=…`) and
  mounts the registered panel component.
- `index.html` — defines bb's built-in theme tokens (extracted from the bb
  app bundle): the dark set on `html.dark`, a light set on `html:not(.dark)`,
  plus a minimal preflight (the plugin's compiled CSS ships without one
  because the host app provides it) and the `data-bb-plugin="thread-board"`
  attribute so the compiled utilities' scoping matches.
- `shoot.mjs` — the capture driver. Captures three shots in both themes,
  toggling the `dark` class per pass: board with the thread pane open
  (1920x1080), plus board and thread pane at phone size (390x844) —
  `name-dark.png` / `name-light.png` files.

Regenerate the screenshots:

```sh
npm i --no-save puppeteer-core   # uses the system Chrome, no download
npx vite --config scripts/screenshot/vite.config.ts   # terminal 1
node scripts/screenshot/shoot.mjs                     # terminal 2
```

`CHROME_PATH` and `HARNESS_URL` override the Chrome binary and harness URL.
